Welcome to the Resistance!


If you are reading this, it means you’ve completed all the step necessary to learn the truth! 


We created the Resistance because Director Hopper was selling Institute secrets and technologies to the highest bidder, regardless of their morals or how they would use the information. 


The director’s own daughter, Grace, discovered the sales and was forced into hiding, so the Director began the lie of her kidnapping. 


We now believe enough Agents have become aware of the truth and we can begin to rebuild the Institute, with Grace as our new Director.


She will contact you soon, congratulations agent!
